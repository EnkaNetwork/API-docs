He runs a martial arts school in Failume Heights, apparently only because a certain grandmaster once suggested he open one.\nThe school doesn't even have a name, he isn't looking for fame for fortune, and he's never once told his students to shout slogans about passing down his art.\nOnly Banyue Shifu himself knows that the obsession called repentance burns that iron heart, day and night. A single mistake could send him spiralling.\n\n\"Greed is like fire. When kept in check, it lights the way forward, but left unchecked, it burns you instead.\""
